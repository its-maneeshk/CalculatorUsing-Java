## Installation

To set up and run the **CalculatorApp**, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**:
   ```bash
   cd CalculatorApp
   ```
2. **Compile the project: Compile the Java classes using your preferred IDE or from the command line:**:
   ```bash
   javac -d classFiles src/**/*.java
   ```
   * "-d" will store all class file in "classFile" folder
2. **Compile the project: Compile the Java classes using your preferred IDE or from the command line:**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/**/*.java
   ```
3. **Run the application: After compilation, run the main application:**
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Calculatorapp.Calculatorapp

# How It Works
**Main Functionalities**
